0,While bismuth compounds Pepto Bismol decreased the number of bowel movements in those with travelers diarrhea  they do not decrease the length of illness  Anti motility agents like loperamide are also effective at reducing the number of stools but not the duration of disease  These agents should be used only if bloody diarrhea is not present   Diosmectite  a natural aluminomagnesium silicate clay  is effective in alleviating symptoms of acute diarrhea in children  and also has some effects in chronic functional diarrhea  radiation induced diarrhea  and chemotherapy induced diarrhea  Another absorbent agent used for the treatment of mild diarrhea is kaopectate   Racecadotril an antisecretory medication may be used to treat diarrhea in children and adults  It has better tolerability than loperamide  as it causes less constipation and flatulence,"O,B-med,I-med,B-med,I-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,O,B-med,I-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,O,B-diag"
1,Diarrhea  also spelled diarrhoea  is the condition of having at least three loose  liquid  or watery bowel movements each day  It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss  Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour  This can progress to decreased urination  loss of skin color  a fast heart rate  and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe  Loose but non watery stools in babies who are exclusively breastfed  however  are normal,"B-diag,O,O,B-diag,O,O,O,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,I-diag,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,I-diag,B-diag,O,O,O,B-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,I-diag,O,B-diag,I-diag,I-diag,O,O,B-diag,O,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
2,Antiretroviral therapy ART is recommended for all HIV infected individuals to reduce the risk of disease progression  ART also is recommended for HIV infected individuals for the prevention of transmission of HIV  Patients starting ART should be willing and able to commit to treatment and understand the benefits and risks of therapy and the importance of adherence  Patients may choose to postpone therapy  and providers  on a case by case basis  may elect to defer therapy on the basis of clinical and or psychosocial factors,"B-med,I-med,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3,The following drugs are considered as DMARDs  methotrexate  hydroxychloroquine  sulfasalazine  leflunomide  TNF alpha inhibitors certolizumab  infliximab and etanercept  abatacept  and anakinra  Rituximab and tocilizumab are monoclonal antibodies and are also DMARDs  Use of tocilizumab is associated with a risk of increased cholesterol levels   Hydroxychloroquine  apart from its low toxicity profile  is considered effective in the moderate RA treatment   The most commonly used agent is methotrexate with other frequently used agents including sulfasalazine and leflunomide  Leflunomide is effective when used from      months  with similar effectiveness to methotrexate when used for   years  Sulfasalazine also appears to be most effective in the short term treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  Sodium aurothiomalate gold and cyclosporin are less commonly used due to more common adverse effects  However  cyclosporin was found to be effective in the progressive RA when used up to one year  Agents may be used in combinations however  people may experience greater side effects  Methotrexate is the most important and useful DMARD and is usually the first treatment  A combined approach with methotrexate and biologics improves ACR    HAQ scores and RA remission rates  Triple therapy consisting of methotrexate  sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine may also effectively control disease activity  Adverse effects should be monitored regularly with toxicity including gastrointestinal  hematologic  pulmonary  and hepatic  Side effects such as nausea  vomiting or abdominal pain can be reduced by taking folic acid,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,B-med,B-med,B-med,B-med,B-med,I-med,I-med,B-med,B-med,O,B-med,O,O,O,B-med,O,B-med,O,B-med,I-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,I-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,I-diag,B-med,I-med,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,B-med,O,B-diag,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,I-diag"

5,Bats are the most common source of rabies in humans in North and South America  Western Europe  and Australia  In the United States  there were    cases of human rabies from               of which were attributed to bats  In North America  about half of human rabies instances are cryptic  meaning that the patient has no known bite history  While it has been speculated that rabies virus could be transmitted through aerosols  studies of the rabies virus have concluded that this is only feasible in limited conditions  These conditions include a very large colony of bats in a hot and humid cave with poor ventilation  While two human deaths in      and      had been tentatively attributed to aerosolization of the rabies virus after entering a cave with bats   investigations of the   reported human cases revealed that both infections could be explained by means other than aerosol transmission   It is instead generally thought that most instances of cryptic rabies are the result of an unknown bat bite  Bites from a bat can be so small that they are not visible without magnification equipment  for example  Outside of bites  rabies virus exposure can also occur if infected fluids come in contact with a mucous membrane or a break in the skin  Rabies virus has also been transmitted when an infected human unknowingly dies of rabies  and their organs are transplanted to others,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

7,Bacterial vaginosis is caused by bacteria that change the vaginal microbiota caused by an overgrowth of bacteria that crowd out the Lactobacilli species that maintain healthy vaginal microbial populations  Other non bacterial vaginal infections include  yeast infection candidiasis  Trichomonas vaginalis trichomoniasis  Bacterial meningitis is a bacterial inflammation of the meninges  that is  the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord  Bacterial pneumonia is a bacterial infection of the lungs  Urinary tract infection is predominantly caused by bacteria  Symptoms include the strong and frequent sensation or urge to urinate  pain during urination  and urine that is cloudy  The main causal agent is Escherichia coli  Urine is typically sterile but contains a variety of salts  and waste products  Bacteria can ascend into the bladder or kidney and causing cystitis and nephritis  Bacterial gastroenteritis is caused by enteric  pathogenic bacteria  These pathogenic species are usually distinct from the usually harmless bacteria of the normal gut flora  But a different strain of the same species may be pathogenic  The distinction is sometimes difficult as in the case of Escherichia  Bacterial skin infections include  Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection commonly seen in children  It is caused by Staphylococcus aureus  and Streptococcus pyogenes  Erysipelas is an acute streptococcus bacterial infection of the deeper skin layers that spreads via with lymphatic system  Cellulitis is a diffuse inflammation of connective tissue with severe inflammation of dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin  Cellulitis can be caused by normal skin flora or by contagious contact  and usually occurs through open skin  cuts  blisters  cracks in the skin  insect bites  animal bites  burns  surgical wounds  intravenous drug injection  or sites of intravenous catheter insertion  In most cases it is the skin on the face or lower legs that is affected  though cellulitis can occur in other tissues,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,I-diag,B-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,I-diag,O,B-diag,I-diag,B-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,I-diag,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,O,B-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,B-diag,O,O,O,O,I-diag,B-diag,O,O,B-diag,I-diag,B-med,I-med,I-med,O,O,O,O,I-med,I-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

10,Much like viral pathogens  infection by certain bacterial pathogens can be prevented via vaccines  Vaccines against bacterial pathogens include the anthrax vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine  Many other bacterial pathogens lack vaccines as a preventive measure  but infection by these bacteria can often be treated or prevented with antibiotics  Common antibiotics include amoxicillin  ciprofloxacin  and doxycycline  Each antibiotic has different bacteria that it is effective against and has different mechanisms to kill that bacteria  For example  doxycycline inhibits the synthesis of new proteins in both gram negative and gram positive bacteria which leads to the death of the affected bacteria,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,I-med,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,B-med,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11,Some antidepressants are used as a treatment for social anxiety disorder  but their efficacy is not entirely convincing  as only a small proportion of antidepressants showed some efficacy for this condition  Paroxetine was the first drug to be FDA approved for this disorder  Its efficacy is considered beneficial  although not everyone responds favorably to the drug  Sertraline and fluvoxamine extended release were later approved for it as well  while escitalopram is used off label with acceptable efficacy  However  there isnt enough evidence to support citalopram for treating social phobia  and fluoxetine was no better than placebo in clinical trials  SSRIs are used as a first line treatment for social anxiety  but they dont work for everyone  One alternative would be venlafaxine  which is a SNRI  It showed benefits for social phobia in five clinical trials against placebo  while the other SNRIs are not considered particularly useful for this disorder as many of them didnt undergo testing for it  As of now  it is unclear if duloxetine and desvenlafaxine can provide benefits for social anxiety sufferers  However  another class of antidepressants called MAOIs are considered effective for social anxiety  but they come with many unwanted side effects and are rarely used  Phenelzine was shown to be a good treatment option  but its use is limited by dietary restrictions  Moclobemide is a RIMA and showed mixed results but still got approval in some European countries for social anxiety disorder  TCA antidepressants  such as clomipramine and imipramine  are not considered effective for this anxiety disorder in particular  This leaves out SSRIs such as paroxetine  sertraline and fluvoxamine CR as acceptable and tolerated treatment options for this disorder,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,B-diag,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,I-diag,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
12,However  existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug  which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians support for its use,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,B-med,I-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

14,If a tuberculosis infection does become active  it most commonly involves the lungs in about     of cases  Symptoms may include chest pain and a prolonged cough producing sputum  About     of people may not have any symptoms i e  they remain  asymptomatic   Occasionally  people may cough up blood in small amounts  and in very rare cases  the infection may erode into the pulmonary artery or a Rasmussens aneurysm  resulting in massive bleeding  Tuberculosis may become a chronic illness and cause extensive scarring in the upper lobes of the lungs  The upper lung lobes are more frequently affected by tuberculosis than the lower ones  The reason for this difference is not clear  It may be due to either better air flow  or poor lymph drainage within the upper lungs,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,I-diag,O,O,B-diag,B-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,I-diag,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15,In        of active cases  the infection spreads outside the lungs  causing other kinds of TB  These are collectively denoted as  extrapulmonary tuberculosis   Extrapulmonary TB occurs more commonly in people with a weakened immune system and young children  In those with HIV  this occurs in more than     of cases  Notable extrapulmonary infection sites include the pleura in tuberculous pleurisy  the central nervous system in tuberculous meningitis  the lymphatic system in scrofula of the neck  the genitourinary system in urogenital tuberculosis  and the bones and joints in Pott disease of the spine  among others  A potentially more serious  widespread form of TB is called  disseminated tuberculosis   it is also known as miliary tuberculosis  Miliary TB currently makes up about     of extrapulmonary cases,"O,O,O,O,O,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
16,Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis  resulting in disease  they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism  An example would include the ability of the herpes simplex virus  which causes cold sores  to remain in a dormant state within the human body  This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses  including Epstein Barr virus  which causes glandular fever  and varicella zoster virus  which causes chickenpox and shingles  Most people have been infected with at least one of these types of herpes virus  These latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial  as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens  such as Yersinia pestis,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,O,B-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17,Examples of common human diseases caused by viruses include the common cold  influenza  chickenpox  and cold sores  Many serious diseases such as rabies  Ebola virus disease  AIDS HIV  avian influenza  and SARS are caused by viruses  The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is described in terms of virulence  Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent  such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus   HHV  and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome  There is controversy over whether the bornavirus  previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses  could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,I-diag,B-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,I-diag,O,O"
18,All medical applications known so far involve not pure adamantane  but its derivatives  The first adamantane derivative used as a drug was amantadine   first      as an antiviral drug against various strains of flu and then to treat Parkinsons disease  Other drugs among adamantane derivatives include adapalene  adapromine  bromantane  carmantadine  chlodantane  dopamantine  memantine  rimantadine  saxagliptin  tromantadine  and vildagliptin  Polymers of adamantane have been patented as antiviral agents against HIV,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-diag,I-diag,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B-med,O,B-med,O,O,B-med,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
